# Contao Config Element Type Bundle

This bundle contains a generic interface, an generic data class and concrete independent implementations for config element types. 

Config element types are designed to specify things that can occur multiple times on the same item (e.g. many fields of the same type) and used in [List Bundle](https://github.com/heimrichhannot/contao-list-bundle) and [Reader Bundle](https://github.com/heimrichhannot/contao-reader-bundle).
